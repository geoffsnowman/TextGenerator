# TextGenerator
This is a C# library for generating random text. It is inspired by ideas from Tracery and some similar ideas I came up with on my own before I had found Tracery. (The original version was a haiku generator and that was written before I even knew Tracery existed.) 

I hope to turn this into a much more featured generative text engine over time but we'll see how that goes. I have some ideas to vastly condense the grammar. I'll probably chuck out the Word object in the next version.

At the moment, this isn't ready for prime time. It doesn't have many features, it has no unit tests, and the vocabulary format is likely to change.
